        <h3>Charles House Center for Community Eldercare </h3>
        <p>The Daytime Eldercare Program at the Center for Community Eldercare accommodates up to 36 participants per day, in a therapeutic social engagement model of care. Family caregivers receive much needed respite while participants develop new friendships, social connections and a strong sense of belonging. The Daytime Program fosters small group intimacy with engaging meaningful activities—a hallmark of the Charles House program. Charles House Eldercare Homes are unique and innovative places developed and operated using the precepts of the Household Model in the Culture Change movement in long-term care. They are truly neighborhood-based homes, existing as part of the neighborhood.
            </p>
        <ul> 
            <li>In March, 2011, Charles House-Yorktown welcomed its first six residents. Charles House-Yorktown is a completely renovated family home that has become a valued part of the Heritage Hills neighborhood in Chapel Hill. 
                </li>
            <li>As of September, 2014, the second Eldercare Home - Charles House-Winmore is home to six more residents who are enjoying life in the Charles House style. This house was designed and built specifically for the safety and comfort of the residents.
